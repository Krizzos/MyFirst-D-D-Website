You need to decide what race and class your character is going to be, as well as their background.<strong>NOTE -&nbsp;</strong>It is highly recommended
                    that you use a bookmark to mark where each of your chosen selections start, as you will need to reference each section multiple times. This will dramatically reduce the time needed to create a character.<strong>Choose a Race</strong><em>Race is your character's species. Your character's race helps determine your physical look as well as giving you natural talents. Racial traits include the following: Ability Score Increase, Age, Alignment, Size, Speed, Languages, and Subraces. You can read the first few paragraphs of each race's section to get an idea of what each of them are.</em><br><strong>NOTE -&nbsp;</strong>Locate
                    the "Racial Traits" section (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Figure 1.1</span>) inside your race's section. This section is referenced specifically in multiple other steps.Choose one of the following races:Dwarf- Page 18

                    an example.<strong>(1) Ability Scores:</strong><em>Ability Scores are determined via two methods. You may roll dice to determine which numbers you have to work with, you can choose to use the default numbers. Also, your race applies some benefits to certain ability scores.</em>To
                    determine you Ability Scores, do the following:Choose&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">one of the following</span>&nbsp;methods to generate your ability stats:Roll for statsRoll 1d6 four times, or roll 4d6 once. (End

                    your race section, and add Ability Score increases to the ability/abilities specified by your race.<strong>NOTE -&nbsp;</strong>See&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Figure 2.4</span>&nbsp;as an example of what you are
                    looking for in the book..<strong>(2) Ability Modifier:</strong><em>The Ability Modifier is the amount you would add to the dice roll as you are playing the game. If your modifier is a +2, and you rolled a 12, you final score for that check is 14. The higher your result, the better, and the number you are trying to beat is determined by your DM based on the difficulty of the task.</em>To
                    determine the Ability Modifier, do the following:The modifier is determined by the Ability Score:<br>Ability Score = Modifier2-3 = - 44-5 = - 36-7 = - 28-9 = - 110-11 = + 012-13 = + 114-15 = + 216-17 = + 318-19 = + 420-21 = + 5<br><br><strong>NOTE&nbsp;</strong>-

                    blank.<strong>(4) Proficiency Modifier:</strong><em>Proficiency Modifier is a bonus you add to any checks made with a skill or weapon you are proficient with. All characters start with a +2 proficiency modifier at level 1. This will increase as a character levels up. Reference your class section to see at what levels this increases.&nbsp;</em><br>Enter
                    a "+2" in the proficiency box.<strong>(5) Saving Throws:</strong><em>Saving throws are ability checks that you make when someone else is targeting you, such as a spell that you are trying to resist.</em>To calculate your saving throws,
                    do the following:Determine which saving throws you are proficient in:Your class will determine which two saving throws you are proficient in. Reference your classes "Class Features" section.Fill in the circle next to the saving throws
                    in which you are proficient.<br>.Calculate proficient saving throw modifiers:For all saving throws that your character is proficient, or has the circle filled in, you add the relevant ability modifier with your proficiency modifier.<br><br><strong>EXAMPLE -&nbsp;</strong>If
                    you had a Dexterity modifier of +3, and a proficiency modifier of +2, than your proficient saving throw of Dexterity +5.&nbsp;<br>.<br>Calculate non-proficient saving throws:For the remainder of your saving throws, the modifiers are
                    simply the relevant ability modifier as you do not add the proficiency modifier.<br><br><strong>NOTE&nbsp;</strong>- See&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Figure 2.2</span>&nbsp;for an example.<strong>(6) Skill Scores:</strong><em>Skill scores are ability checks that apply to specific scenarios. If you are trying to bluff someone, you would use Deception. If you are trying to tell if someone is bluffing, you would use Insight. These scores are added to any rolls you make for one of these scores.</em>To
                    calculate your skill modifiers, do the following:Determine which skills you are proficient in:Reference&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">both&nbsp;</span>your class and your background to determine which skills you are
                    proficient with.Fill in the circle next to the skills in which you are proficient.<br>.Calculate proficient skills modifiers:For all skills that your character is proficient, or has the circle filled in, you add the relevant ability
                    score modifier with your proficiency modifier.<br><br><strong>EXAMPLE -&nbsp;</strong>If you had a Charisma modifier of +3, and a proficiency modifier of +2, than your proficient skill of Deception is +5.&nbsp;<br>.<br>Calculate non-proficient
                    skills:For the remainder of your skills, the modifiers are simply the relevant ability modifier as you do not add the proficiency modifier.<br><br><strong>NOTE -&nbsp;</strong>See&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Figure 2.2</span>&nbsp;for
                    an example.<strong>(7) Passive Perception:</strong><em>Passive Wisdom is your characters natural awareness of their surroundings. When you are not actively looking for something, this score determines what you see without needing to make a check.</em>To
                    calculate your Passive Perception, do the following:Passive Perception starts at 10Add or subtract your Perception skill bonus<br>.<br><strong>EXAMPLE -</strong>&nbsp;If your Perception is a +1, then your Passive Perception is 11.=========================================================<br></p>

Your Armor Class, or AC, determines how hard you are to hit in combat.</em><br>To
                    calculate your armor class, do the following:If you are wearing armor, look up your armor in the table on page 145 (PDF 44).Follow the AC calculation in the table<br>.<br><strong>NOTE -</strong><em>&nbsp;This may be a straight number, or it may be a number added to your Dexterity Modifier.</em><br><em>.</em><br><strong>EXAMPLE -</strong>&nbsp;Chainmail

                    determine your movement, do the following:Check your race section in the Player's Hand Book for their speed.<strong>(4) Hit Dice:</strong><em>Hit dice determine how hearty you are, and your ability to heal when resting.</em>To determine
                    your hit dice, do the following:The number of hit dice you have is determined by your level (These instructions assume level 1, so therefore 1 hit dice.)The type of hit dice is determined by your class. Check the class section of the
                    Player's Hand Book.<br>.<br><strong>EXAMPLE -&nbsp;</strong>A level 1 Rogue has 1d8, as Rogues have d8's as hit dice, and he is level 1 so he has one of them.<strong>(5) Hit Point Maximum:</strong><em>Your hit point maximum is the most HPs you can have.</em>To
                    calculate you maximum HP at level 1, do the following:Take the maximum value of your hit die and add your Constitution modifier<br><strong>.</strong><br><strong>EXAMPLE -</strong>&nbsp;A d8 hit die with a +1 Constitution modifier =
                    8 + 1 = 9 maximum hit points.&nbsp;<br>.<br><strong>NOTE -</strong><em>&nbsp;As you level up, at each level you roll a hit die and add your Constitution modifier, and add that to your total hit points.</em><strong>(6) Current Hit Points:</strong><em>Current hit points is the amount of health you have remaining. This number can not go above your hit point maximum. You may use this block as you play the game to keep track of damage you have taken.
