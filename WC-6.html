                    <div class="text">
                        <p>A world is just an empty place without people, places and things to fill it and bring it to life. My favorite fantasy worlds feel lived in and are places I want to explore even more. Last year, I decided it was finally time to
                            tackle building my own fantasy world and in this article (Part 6), I share how I started filling my fantasy world, called Vodari, with detail. I am a rookie world builder, but that didn’t stop me from taking my ideas and turning
                            them into my own world that my players and I are visiting each week. This article looks at the player options I provided and how I filled the world with people and places.<br><br>In my campaign, player character will typically
                            spend more time sailing ships, exploring islands, and visiting seaport cities than dungeon delving. So this is an important consideration for my players when they are creating their characters. Make sure the player options
                            you offer your players match for your campaign world and that you provide enough information for them to be able to create a PC that fits in that world.<br></p>
                        <h1><strong>Races of Vodari</strong><br></h1>
                        <p>In my campaign player’s handbook, for each race I provided context of their place in Vodari to add-on to the Player’s Handbook. Here is an example looking at humans in Vodari. A little info like this for each race is a big help
                            and is usually included in campaign guides for published settings. These guidelines are also useful for creating NPC characters.<br><br><strong>Playing a Human in Vodari</strong><br><br>Humans were among the hardest hit by
                            the Godwar and almost all of their former nations no longer exist.Most of human history before the Godwar has been long forgotten with their libraries being lost to the sea when their cities sank.The descendants of those surviving
                            humans are the most physically diverse and numerous people in Vodari and can be found living on quiet farms, busting seaside cities or in barbarian villages to the far north. Human society is filled with a wide array of shared
                            traditions, as the people of these lost nations have become one big cultural mix.Human Kings, Lord Wardens, and Chancellors rule the southern islands. The peaceful co-existence of these nations is challenged daily by territory
                            and trade disputes that could erupt into all out war.You can select a human ethnicity from the Player’s Handbook p.30-31, create your own or select the common “mixed-ethnicity”.Mixed-ethnicity is the norm for humans in both
                            the northern and southern islands, even with the nobility. Only a small number of humans can trace back their lineage to the nations of the time before the Godwar.<br><br><strong>Here is what I provided my players as guidelines for choosing a race…</strong><br><br>You
                            can create a player character using any race from the D&amp;D 5th&nbsp;Edition Player’s Handbook and the added Minotaur race. Please consider the following when selecting a race for your character.<br><br>Humans, Halflings,
                            High Elves, Rock Gnomes, Half-Elves and Hill Dwarves are common.Mountain Dwarves tend to be found in their mountain home to the west, but would not be a rare sight in a larger settlement.Forest Gnomes and Wood Elves are less
                            common sights on the streets and seas of Vodari and they tend to keep to their forest homes.Half-orcs are an extreme rarity in the civilized lands of the more southern islands. In barbarian lands, they would be less common,
                            but could be found in neighboring tribes or even living in barbarian settlements.Dragonborn and Tieflings are available as selections for a playable character. They are an extreme rarity on the streets and seas of Vodari.Ice
                            Dwarves, Aquatic Dwarves and Aquatic Elves are very rarely seen and even unknown by many people of the islands of Vodari.The rarely seen Minotaur race is a playable character race and information on playing a Minotaur is available
                            in this guide.<br><br>For class options, I didn’t see any reason to limit any of the classes. I tried to find a place in my world for swashbuckling rogues, wizards, monks, whatever. I also added a bunch of backgrounds that
                            were specific to Vodari’s seafaring setting.<br></p>
                        <h1><strong>People &amp; Places</strong><br></h1>
                        <p>Vodari is a world where chains of islands ring a large, never ending storm. Visitors to Vodari will find pastoral villages, luxurious palaces, treetop villages, mountain fortresses, wizard towers, dangerous ports, undersea cities
                            and more. While most nations in the southern islands live in relative calm and peace, Vodari is a dangerous place with many perils. On the southern seas you’ll find pirates and sea monsters, crime filled ports and raging storms.
                            To the west are the forested lands of the elves. To the north are wild, uncivilized islands with barbarians, orcs, monsters and dragons. To the east the dwarves fight a continuous war deep under the mountains. To the far south
                            are unexplored islands with thick jungles and vast sand deserts. Under the sea a great war rages between the sea elves and saguagin.<br><br>For my world I looked at my map and though about where all the people would have settled
                            and how they would have interacted over the last 1000 years. Once I had the nations are set out based on the map, I need to fill each settlement with locations and NPCs. I have provided a modified sample from my campaign notes
                            from a settlement that I built out, using Pathfinder’s starter set for inspiration. Once you have locations and NPCs created, you can start to think about adventure hooks.<br><br><strong>EXAMPLETON</strong><br><br>Exampleton
