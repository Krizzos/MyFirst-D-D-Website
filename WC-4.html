                    <div class="text">
                        <p>From Asgard to Zothique, there are many, many richly imagined worlds that have been created for books, games, movies, television and even just for fun. My favorite fantasy worlds feel like a real working place with their own currency,
                            food, technology and magic. Last year, I decided it was finally time to tackle building my own fantasy world and in this article (Part 4), I share how I came up with details to make my seafaring world of&nbsp;<a href="http://tribality.com/2014/09/10/seas-of-vodari-campaign-setting/">Vodari</a>&nbsp;feel
                            more like a real place. Since this was my first crack at world building, I started small with just minor changes to the way a typical fantasy world works and added in a little gunpowder to allow for muskets and cannons.<br></p>
                        <h1><strong>Currency</strong><br></h1>
                        <p>When building out a campaign world, thinking about what people in the world call money can be a really nice detail. Currency has many names in fantasy and sci-fi settings such as Gil (Final Fantasy), Crowns, Units (Guardians of
                            the Galaxy), Credits and more. Even if you settle on the old gold standard, nicknames for each coin can be a nice touch. Naming coins for the animal (real or monster) or person (king/queen of the land) they have minted onto
                            a face is one way. Old names for coins can also be fun to use such as Groats, Sheckels, Farthings, Florins,&nbsp;Sovereigns, Guineas and Doubloons. For larger amounts, you might consider introducing bank notes, if some form
                            of banking exists in your world. Whatever currency you choose, make sure it fits the setting and tone of your campaign and will actually work as an efficient method of exchange (complex math can be boring – really try to keep
                            to a base 10 system).<br><br>The lack of money is the root of all evil.<br>~ Mark Twain<br><br>When building out my campaign world, I really didn’t see the need to mess around with money too much. I just decided to drop Electrum
                            coins (ep) as a standard of exchange and stick with Platinum, Gold, Silver and Copper. I also like to use bank notes for larger amounts, especially if the PCs are being paid for a job by a public official. In hindsight, I wish
                            I came up with nicknames for my coins that sound more pirate-like such as Doubloons, but I was worried a name like that would pull us out of Vodari and into Earth’s actual history. I’m thinking that I am going to have my NPC
                            pirates call gold coins Doubloons, Crowns or something with more flavor.<br><br><strong>A few things you can do to make the money of your world special:</strong><br><br><strong>Unique Appearance:</strong>&nbsp;Make the appearance
                            of the coins your players find be significant. Each empire can mint their own style, players can find coins from an evil empire of the past, etc. In Vodari, I thought about making the location of where the coins originate from
                            be a bigger deal. I decided to leave that a detail for any specific treasures where that level of detail could matter for details such as who paid the dead mercenaries or who the pirates plundered to get their gold chests.<strong>Give Out Actual Coins (or replicas):</strong>&nbsp;My
                            Vodari campaign is a virtual game on&nbsp;<a href="http://roll20.net/">Roll20</a>, but if we played in person it would be so fun to have little treasure chests full of fake coins. See&nbsp;<a href="http://tribality.com/2015/02/03/5-fun-gimmicks-for-dd/">5 Fun Gimmicks for D&amp;D</a>&nbsp;for
                            this idea and others.<strong>Bartering:</strong>&nbsp;Encounter a barter only culture for a session or two, but I would never recommend basing your game on something that crazy. If civilization breaks down in your world, you’ll
                            need to demonstrate that currency is suddenly worth much less, since you can not eat it.<strong>Another Method of Exchange:</strong>&nbsp;Vodari has an island of ape people that use gems as an alternate method of exchange (well
                            it did until my players arrived). In the&nbsp;<a href="http://tribality.com/2014/09/01/adventure-time-4e-homebrew-rules-etc/">Adventure Time homebrew rules</a>&nbsp;players find US dollars or coins in dungeon treasure hoards.
                            In the movie&nbsp;<em>In Time</em>, people trade the time they have left to live for everyday items like coffee.<br></p>
                        <h1><strong>Food</strong><br></h1>
                        <p>Otik’s Famous Spiced Potatoes (Dragonlance), blue milk (Star Wars), snakes and monkey brains (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) or the replicator from Star Trek are all examples of food being used to make a world feel real.
                            It’s easy to just have your players eat “food”, but it can be more. Describe the food and even create something unique and exotic that is only in your world. Make it part of the story like coconuts on Gilligan’s Island had
                            coconuts or Breaking Bad’s Los Pollos chicken.<br><br>My players started out on in a small town, on a small island called Faraway. The island is famous for its stinky, barbed, rust colored fruit, called a Dragon Pear, that
                            grows in orchards outside of the port town. When my players had to visit their first tavern I called it the Rusty Dragon, named for the fruit. Can you guess what the tavern’s signature dish is? It’s fried dragon pears and they
                            taste awesome! Just a couple of details about a fruit and my world has some real details.<br><br>As my players travel around in my world…<br><br>If a cart gets knocked over, maybe it is full of dragon pears.If the crowd throws
                            rotten food, why not throw some stinky dragon pears.When my players travel to another town they might see some dragon pears at the market that cost three times more than the price just paid back on Faraway.<br><br>Your players
                            can make food memorable too. Allow them to hunt and be specific about what they catch. If they kill a beast in a fight, why not eat it. When my players killed a giant crab, they cooked it and then ate it during a short rest.
                            I think one of the players even had their PC carrying spices to make food on the road taste better.<br></p>
                        <h1><strong>Technology</strong><br></h1>
                        <p>The level of technology in your world, or even from land to land, is a dominate factor in the way the world works and how the campaign feels. Who has the best technology can also be a major story arc in your campaign. Which side
                            has the death ray, atomic bomb, Death Star or whatever can be the entire focus of your PCs efforts. The level of technology and theme are both&nbsp; something your should really consult your players about. If your players are
                            excited about playing in a world of sword and sorcery and you start introducing steam powered air ships and paddle boats, that is a major miss. But you need to be able to create a world that both you and your players can enjoy.
                            If you are lucky, you’ll have players who can help you come up with a theme for your campaign that everyone can enjoy.<br><br>When I was starting to think about our next campaign, we were running a game set in the&nbsp;<a href="http://tribality.com/2014/09/20/nentir-vale/">Nentir Vale</a>and
                            our group was looking to move away from goblins, kobolds, gnolls, orcs and red dragons. I looked at Guardians of the Galaxy, Maleficent, Hunger Games, Star Wars, Star Trek, Firefly, Van Helsing, Three Musketeers, Zelda, Pirates
                            of the Caribbean, Aquaman, Legend of Korra and more for ideas. A few pages of notes later, I was able to present the following campaign ideas to my players:<br><br><strong>World of Islands</strong><br>Epic medieval fantasy
                            world where most land was covered by the sea long ago in a devasting war between two sister gods<strong>Western</strong><br>Desolate Western themed world with gunslingers and magic (see Wild Arms)<strong>Gothic Horror</strong><br>Ravenloft
                            / Van Helsing / Hansel &amp; Gretel theme where players are a group of monster hunters<strong>Space</strong><br>Magic is science in a galactic empire of planets under attack by “aliens”<strong>Feywild</strong><br>See Maleficent,
                            Zelda &amp; D&amp;D Feywild<br><br>As a group we decided that letting me build out a world where a small continent was destroyed leaving scattered islands that the few survivors of this cataclysm colonized. Our swashbuckling
                            adventures in the Seas of Vodari are set in a world with a technology level similar to that of the Renaissance. I started to develop a world with gunpowder (for cannons and muskets) and a little steam power being used by the
                            rock gnomes in their far off island kingdom.<br><br>Once you set the level of technology for your world, you’ll need to provide that technology to your players. Since my world was basically a default D&amp;D 5th edition world
                            with gunpowder, I only had to create and borrow a dozen items to provide our unique mix of technology directly to my players. I also has to add boats and a combat system, which I am covering in my&nbsp;<a href="http://tribality.com/2014/12/26/naval-combat-rules-dd-5th-edition-part-1/">Naval Combat series</a>.<br></p>

                                Pirates often wear bandanas or tricorn hats, while captains prefer bicornes and may wear them either “fore-and-aft” (with the points in front of and behind them) or “athwart” (sideways).<strong>Reed Breathing Tube</strong>&nbsp;|
                                1 sp | 1/2 lb.<br>Allows wearer to breathe from 1-2 feet under the surface of the water in calm waters. If swimming in rough waters, the use of the device will be difficult or impossible.<strong>Sextant</strong>&nbsp;|
                                500 gp | 2lbs<br>A sextant is used to determine your latitude, and grants you Advantage on Survival checks made to navigate while above ground during the day or night. You must be able to see the sun (day) or stars (night)
                                to use this device.<strong>Tar Bomb</strong>&nbsp;| 15 gp | 2 lbs<br>A tar bomb is an easy weapon to make, and devastating in use. A head-sized lump of tar is wrapped around a rope and set on fire. You use the rope to lob
                                the burning tar onto an enemy’s deck, where it sticks and sets the ship alight. A hit with a tar bomb deals 1d4 points of fire damage and has the potential to set the struck object or creature on fire, causing an additional
                                1d6 points of fire damage each round unless the target or an adjacent creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity save to extinguish the flames as a full-round action. Knocking the tar bomb or the burning creature or object into a
                                body of water or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.<strong>Tattoo</strong>&nbsp;| 1 cp – 20gp (or free… ouch!)<br>The quality, size, and number of colors used are all a factor in the cost
                                of a tattoo. Tattoos can be used to enhance character backgrounds and appearance.<br></p>
                            <h1><strong>Magic</strong><br></h1>
                            <p>As much as the technology level of your world can set the feel of the entire campaign and shape empires, magic can be used as an even more powerful force to wield. Magic can give people the power to heal and build or kill and
                                destroy. Like technology, it can be a blessing or a curse. For my first world building exercise, I decided that leaving magic alone would be a really great idea. However you decide to use magic in your world, you’ll need
                                to think about the following:<br><br><strong>How does magic work? What is the source of magical power for each type of magic user? Nature, arcane, divine?</strong><br>In Vodari, I just went with the way things are set out
                                in the rules for Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition.<strong>How is magicical knowledge shared and controlled in your world?</strong><br>In Vodari, some magically sensitive children are sent to Wizard school to become an
                                apprentice. Clerics are given a gift for their devotion. Druids pass on their knowledge. Sorcerers and Warlocks find their own path.<strong>How common is magic use in your world?</strong><br>In Eberron, magic is used like
                                a utility and in Thor’s Asgard magic and science are the same. In Vodari, the weather is dominated by a magical super hurricane that has been active for almost 1000 years. In my game world, magic users, like adventurers,
                                are rare. Most people are happy to live out their lives on their small islands as farmers and merchants. Those who do travel pray to the gods for safe passage across the dangerous seas of Vodari.<br><br></p>
